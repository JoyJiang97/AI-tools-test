# Analyst Desk Reference: NRC Regulatory Comment Workflow

*(At‑a‑Glance Guide — Print and Keep at Your Desk)*

---

## What This Is

This sheet is a **process guide**, not a writing guide.

Use it to:

- Run the NRC regulatory comment workflow correctly
- Know **what to do next** at each stage
- Avoid common failure modes (scope, authority, partial fixes)

If you are unsure what to do, return to **Step 0**.

---

## Core Rule (Read First)

> **Do not draft comment prose until CFR baselines and proposed changes have been identified and compared.**

Structure → Authority → Comparison → Recommendations → Prose

---

## Required Files (Must Be in the Project)

- Regulatory Comments Instruction File (v0.1)&#x20;
- Regulatory Comment Workflow: Step Prompts (Team SOP)&#x20;
- Notebook LM Deep Research Report (completed) 
- Federal Register Notice (FRN)&#x20;
- 10 CFR PDF snapshot (dated)&#x20;
- Governing statutes (AEA, NEPA, ADVANCE Act, etc.)

If anything is missing, **stop**.

---

## Workflow Steps (Do These in Order)

### STEP -1 — Notebook LM Deep Research (Pre-Chat)

- Create a new Notebook LM workbook&#x20;
- Upload:&#x20;
  - FRN&#x20;
  - 10 CFR html 
  - Governing statutes&#x20;
- Select **Deep Research** mode&#x20;
- Run the standard Deep Research prompt&#x20;
- Save the resulting analytical report

**Output:** Notebook LM Deep Research report

**Rule:** Do not start a drafting chat until this step is complete.

---

### STEP 0 — Confirm Inputs

- Identify FRN + docket&#x20;
- Confirm CFR + statutes are available&#x20;
- Confirm comment deadline

**Output:** Confirmed inputs

---

### STEP 1 — Extract Scope From FRN

- List amended CFR Parts/sections&#x20;
- List referenced CFR sections&#x20;
- Extract FRN questions (verbatim)&#x20;
- Identify defined terms + cross‑references&#x20;
- Build dependency map

**Output:** CFR scope + dependency record

---

### STEP 2 — Pull Existing CFR Text

- Retrieve full baseline text for amended sections&#x20;
- Retrieve full text for key cross‑references (especially definitions)

**Output:** Baseline CFR text record

---

### STEP 3 — Pull Proposed Text

- Extract proposed regulatory text or amendatory instructions from FRN&#x20;
- Preserve numbering and structure

**Output:** Proposed text record

---

### STEP 4 — Compare + Flag Gaps

- Identify additions / deletions / re‑ordering&#x20;
- Flag ambiguity or scope changes&#x20;
- Flag definition drift&#x20;
- Identify **cross‑rule coordination risks**

**Output:** Diff + gap list

---

### STEP 5 — Generate Skeleton (No Prose)

- Use instruction file structure&#x20;
- Insert institutional introduction&#x20;
- Insert **concurrent rulemaking framing paragraphs**
- Insert FRN questions as headers&#x20;
- Add recommendation placeholders to every section

**Output:** Comment skeleton

---

### STEP 6 — Draft (One Section at a Time)

- Front‑loaded recommendation&#x20;
- Authority (CFR + statute)&#x20;
- Analysis tied to text changes
- Implications if not adopted&#x20;
- Closing recommendation

**Output:** Draft comment

---

### STEP 7 — Staff Disposition Hardening

- Apply Staff Disposition Checklist&#x20;
- Pre‑empt “outside scope”&#x20;
- Pre‑empt deferral to other dockets&#x20;
- Ensure coordination language appears:&#x20;
- Near beginning&#x20;
- In at least one technical section&#x20;
- In conclusion

**Output:** Submission‑ready comment

---

## Mandatory Framing (Do Not Omit)

- Institutional introduction paragraph
- Concurrent & pending rulemakings framing section&#x20;
- Explicit recommendations at start/end of sections

---

## If You Are Stuck, Ask Yourself

- Have I identified the **exact CFR text** that exists today?
- Am I assuming another rule will fix this?
- Could staff partially adopt this and still leave a gap?
- Can my recommendation be summarized in one sentence?

If yes → proceed
If no → stop and escalate

## One‑Sentence Reminder
