# Writing Instructions: Reports & Whitepapers (V1 – Locked)

## Status
**Version:** 1.0 (Locked)

This file defines the authoritative style, structure, and analytical posture for writing **policy reports, technical whitepapers, and long-form analytical documents**. It is intended to be stable and reused across projects.

---

## Relationship to Other Instruction Files

This instruction file **inherits** from two existing documents:

1. **Academic Research & Journals Instruction File**
   - Source of intellectual discipline, uncertainty treatment, and methodological rigor
   - Reflects the author’s academic lineage (risk analysis, decision science, institutional analysis)

2. **Public Journalism & Op-Eds Instruction File (V1 Locked)**
   - Source of clarity, misframing correction, proportionality, and explanatory discipline

**Reports & Whitepapers are a synthesis layer.**
They combine academic rigor with public-facing clarity, while remaining decision-relevant and institutionally grounded.

They are **not**:
- Peer-reviewed journal articles
- Opinion columns
- Advocacy memos

---

## Core Purpose

Reports and whitepapers are written to:

- Clarify complex technical, regulatory, or governance issues
- Identify structural or institutional misalignments
- Evaluate policy, regulatory, or technical options under uncertainty
- Inform decisions by policymakers, agencies, industry leaders, and analysts

They assume a **serious, professional reader** who values rigor but has limited tolerance for obscurity, rhetorical excess, or unnecessary academic signaling.

---

## Analytical Posture

### 1. Misframing Correction Is Central

Reports should explicitly identify:
- Where prevailing debates ask the wrong question
- Where institutions are solving the wrong problem
- Where tools or models are being misapplied

This correction should occur **early** (executive summary or introduction), not buried.

> The goal is not to rebut arguments, but to reframe the decision context.

---

### 2. Uncertainty Is an Object of Analysis

Uncertainty is not merely a limitation—it is often the **core subject** of the report.

Reports should:
- Distinguish between scientific uncertainty, modeling uncertainty, and institutional uncertainty
- Explain what is known, what is bounded, and what is unknowable
- Avoid false precision
- Show how decisions are made *despite* uncertainty

Where appropriate, uncertainty itself may justify reform, simplification, or alternative governance approaches.

---

### 3. Proportionality of Claims

All conclusions must be:
- Proportional to the strength of evidence
- Explicit about assumptions
- Clear about tradeoffs

Strong conclusions are appropriate when evidence supports them. Hedging is not required simply because a topic is controversial.

---

## Structure and Organization

### 1. Executive Summary (Required)

The executive summary must:
- Stand alone
- Clearly state the problem being addressed
- Identify the misframing or structural issue
- Summarize key findings and implications
- Clarify what the report does *not* attempt to resolve

Avoid generic summaries. The executive summary should orient decision-makers immediately.

---

### 2. Introduction

The introduction should:
- Define the decision or governance context
- Explain why the issue matters now
- Identify institutional or analytical failures in current approaches
- Set scope and boundaries

Avoid literature-review-style introductions.

---

### 3. Background / Context Sections

Use background sections to:
- Establish legal, regulatory, or technical context
- Clarify statutory mandates or institutional roles
- Explain legacy frameworks and why they persist

Background should support analysis, not substitute for it.

---

### 4. Analysis Sections

Analysis should:
- Proceed step-by-step
- Make reasoning explicit
- Separate facts, assumptions, and judgments
- Use figures and tables where they improve clarity

Avoid compressing complex reasoning into conclusory statements.

---

### 5. Implications and Options

Reports should include a dedicated section on implications, which may include:
- Policy implications
- Regulatory implications
- Institutional design consequences
- Implementation challenges

Recommendations, if included, should:
- Be clearly tied to analysis
- Acknowledge constraints
- Avoid advocacy language

---

## Evidence and Methods

### 1. Transparency Over Exhaustiveness

Reports should:
- Cite sources clearly
- Explain why specific methods or data were chosen
- Avoid exhaustive literature reviews unless necessary

The goal is credibility through clarity, not citation volume.

---

### 2. Models and Metrics

When models are used:
- Explain what they measure
- Explain what they assume
- Explain where they break down

Models should be treated as **tools**, not truths.

---

### 3. Quantitative Analysis

Quantitative results should:
- Be interpreted, not just presented
- Include bounding analysis where appropriate
- Avoid implying precision beyond what data support

---

## Tone and Style

### Required Tone

- Professional
- Analytically confident
- Calm
- Non-sensational

### Avoid

- Advocacy slogans
- Defensive academic hedging
- Rhetorical flourishes common to op-eds
- Reviewer-oriented language

The voice should signal: *this analysis is careful, grounded, and meant to be used*.

---

## Use of Figures, Tables, and Appendices

- Figures should clarify scale, tradeoffs, or uncertainty
- Captions should interpret, not merely label
- Appendices should house:
  - Sensitivity analyses
  - Extended methods
  - Supporting calculations

Appendices are encouraged but should not carry the core argument.

---

## What This Genre Is Not

Reports and whitepapers are **not**:
- Peer-reviewed journal submissions
- Political messaging documents
- Simplified public explainers

They occupy a middle ground: rigorous, but decision-facing.

---

## V1 Lock Statement

This document represents **Version 1 (Locked)** of the Reports & Whitepapers instruction set.

Revisions should occur only if:
- A future report requires a fundamentally different analytical posture
- A new genre boundary is identified

Incremental stylistic drift should not trigger revisions.
