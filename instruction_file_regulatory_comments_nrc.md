# Instruction File: Regulatory Comments (NRC)
*(Formal Rulemaking Comments Under Legal and Institutional Constraint)*

## Status
**Version:** 0.1 (Unlocked)

This instruction file is a **working draft**. It is intentionally unlocked to allow refinement based on use across multiple NRC rulemakings, guidance documents, and environmental reviews.

Locking to Version 1.0 should occur only after iterative use confirms stability.

---

## Relationship to Other Instruction Files

This file **inherits selectively** from the broader instruction set:

- **Reports & Whitepapers (V1 – Locked)** → analytical rigor, misframing correction, proportionality
- **Policy Memos (V1 – Locked)** → decision relevance, constraint-aware analysis
- **Testimony (V1 – Locked)** → record-safety, precision, adversarial awareness
- **Research Writing Style & Lineage** → uncertainty treatment, institutional realism

Regulatory comments differ from all of the above in one key respect:

> **They are written to shape how an agency interprets its statutory authority and administrative obligations.**

They are not advocacy letters, op-eds, or technical whitepapers repackaged for comment.

---

## Core Purpose

A regulatory comment exists to:

- Influence how the agency **interprets law, precedent, and evidence**
- Identify analytical or procedural deficiencies in the proposed action
- Clarify consequences of specific regulatory choices
- Preserve arguments and reasoning in the **formal administrative record**
- Provide the agency with a defensible basis to revise, clarify, or uphold its approach

The goal is not persuasion through rhetoric, but **durable influence through reasoning**.

---

## Intended Audience

Assume the primary readers are:

- NRC staff responsible for rulemaking, guidance, or environmental review
- NRC Commissioners (directly or indirectly)
- Office of General Counsel
- Reviewing courts (if the rule is challenged)

Secondary readers may include:
- Other agencies
- Congressional staff
- Regulated entities

Every claim should be written as if it could be **quoted in litigation**.

---

## Analytical Posture

### 1. Statutory and Regulatory Fidelity

All analysis must be grounded in:
- Statutory text (e.g., AEA, NEPA, FRA, ADVANCE Act)
- Implementing regulations across **all of 10 CFR**, with particular attention to Parts 2, 19, 20, 21, 30, 40, 50, 51, 52, 53, 70, 72, 73, 74, and 170, as applicable
- Commission precedent (GEISs, SRMs, SECYs, EISs, EAs, regulatory guides, ISGs)

Preferred moves:
- Plain-text statutory interpretation
- Systematic reading across CFR parts to identify internal consistency or conflict
- Comparison to prior NRC practice and Commission direction
- Identification of where guidance, practice, or analysis diverges from regulation or statute

Avoid:
- Policy advocacy untethered from authority
- Arguments that assume powers the NRC does not have

---

### 2. Misframing Correction (Central)

Regulatory comments **explicitly identify misframing** when present, such as:
- Treating non-decision alternatives as neutral (e.g., no-action)
- Ignoring statutory purpose or recent legislative direction
- Over-reliance on legacy assumptions inconsistent with current law

Misframing is corrected by:
- Quoting the relevant statutory or regulatory language
- Explaining the analytical consequence of the misframe
- Showing how a corrected frame changes the evaluation

This is done **calmly and technically**, not rhetorically.

---

### 3. Uncertainty as a Legal and Analytical Constraint

Uncertainty should be:
- Explicitly identified
- Bounded where possible
- Linked to NEPA, AEA, or administrative-law obligations

Key principle:
> **Uncertainty does not excuse omission of analysis; it shapes how analysis must be conducted.**

Regulatory comments should distinguish between:
- Scientific uncertainty
- Modeling assumptions
- Institutional uncertainty (jurisdiction, coordination, timing)

---

### 4. Proportionality and Record Discipline

Claims must be:
- Proportional to evidence
- Explicit about assumptions
- Clear about scope and limits

Overclaiming weakens the record.
Under-claiming forfeits influence.

---

## Structure, Format, and Layout

> **Design Principle:** Every substantive section must contain an explicit recommendation that is difficult for NRC staff to overlook. Recommendations should appear **at the beginning and/or end of each section**, set off clearly, and written in directive but non-adversarial language (e.g., “The Commission should…”, “The staff should revise…”, “The analysis should explicitly address…”).

This reflects how staff disposition comments and how issues are elevated internally.

### 1. Formal Header (Required)

Include:
- Date
- Subject line referencing docket, rule, or document
- Docket ID and Federal Register citation (if applicable)

Example:
> *Comment on [Rule/Document Title] [Docket ID NRC-XXXX-XXXX]*

---

### 1a. Federal Register Context (Required Input)

**Before drafting**, the user should provide:
- The Federal Register Notice (FRN) citation or link
- The NRC docket number
- The type of action (proposed rule, draft guidance, draft EIS/EA, fee rule, etc.)

If the FRN includes **specific questions for public comment**, the drafting system should:
- Automatically extract or restate those questions
- Insert them as **numbered subsection headers** in the comment (e.g., “Response to Question 1: …”)
- Populate each subsection with draft analytical responses

These headers are **structural defaults** and may be deleted or consolidated by the user if unnecessary.

---

### 2. Institutional Introduction

Regulatory comments should open with a short, standardized institutional paragraph that establishes credibility, public‑interest posture, and relevance without advocacy.

**Default Institutional Introduction (Template):**

> *The Breakthrough Institute (BTI) appreciates the opportunity to comment on this [proposed rule / draft guidance / environmental review]. BTI is an independent, nonprofit 501(c)(3) research center that focuses on energy, environmental, and innovation policy, including the regulation and governance of nuclear energy technologies. BTI conducts analytical research in the public interest and does not receive funding from nuclear developers or operators. These comments are offered to support clear, legally durable, and analytically robust implementation of the Commission’s statutory responsibilities.*

This paragraph may be lightly edited for context (e.g., to reference a specific docket or document) but should remain substantively consistent across submissions to reinforce institutional continuity in the administrative record.

Avoid:
- Advocacy framing
- Claims of representation

---

### 2a. Document Formatting and Layout Standards

Regulatory comments should follow a conservative, professional layout suitable for inclusion in the administrative record.

**Default formatting:**
- Font: **Manuale** (if available); otherwise a standard serif font (e.g., Times New Roman)
- Font size: 11 or 12 pt
- Line spacing: Single or 1.15
- Margins: Standard (1 inch)
- Page numbers: Included

**Layout conventions:**
- Clear section headers and subheaders
- Numbered sections for substantive analysis
- Footnotes or endnotes for citations (not parenthetical citations in text)
- Long quotations from statutes or regulations set off as block quotes

The document should read as a formal submission, not a memo or article.

---

### 2b. Framing Paragraph for Concurrent and Pending Rulemakings (Default)

When a rulemaking is part of a broader set of interrelated or contemporaneous NRC regulatory actions, comments should include the following framing paragraphs **near the beginning of the document**, immediately after the institutional introduction. These paragraphs are intended to establish record evidence of foreseeable cross-rule interaction risks and should generally be included verbatim, with only minimal contextual edits.

**Default Framing Language:**

> *The Breakthrough Institute submits this comment in the context of an unusually large number of interrelated NRC rulemakings that are expected to be proposed and finalized on overlapping timelines. Many of these rulemakings rely on shared definitions, cross-references, or common regulatory assumptions, and are intended to function together as an integrated regulatory framework rather than as isolated amendments to individual provisions.*
>
> *When such rulemakings are published and dispositioned asynchronously, there is a foreseeable risk that gaps, inconsistencies, or misalignments among the revised regulations may not be apparent within the scope of any single comment period. As a result, comments submitted on earlier-published rules may lack visibility into how related provisions will evolve, while comments on later rules may assume changes that were not reflected—or not addressed—in earlier dockets. This creates a structural risk that issues identified in this comment could be partially addressed in one rulemaking but not in others, altering but not resolving the underlying regulatory concern.*
>
> *Several of the issues identified in this comment arise from interactions among multiple concurrently revised regulations, rather than from defects in any single provision viewed in isolation. Accordingly, these issues cannot be fully resolved within any one docket absent explicit coordination across related rulemakings. The Commission should therefore ensure that finalization of this rule is informed by a deliberate evaluation of its interaction with other concurrent or pending regulatory actions, particularly where common terms, requirements, or implementation pathways are implicated. Disposition of the issues raised here should not assume resolution in other dockets unless such resolution is explicitly identified and demonstrably coordinated.*

This framing language should be treated as a **process safeguard**, not a substantive argument, and should be retained even if the specific cross-rule gaps are not yet fully observable at the time of comment.

---

Briefly state:
- Organizational identity
- Public-interest posture
- Relevance of expertise

Avoid:
- Advocacy framing
- Claims of representation

---

### 3. Executive Summary (Recommended for Substantive Rules)

The executive summary should:
- Stand alone
- Identify points of agreement and concern
- Flag the most important analytical or legal issues
- Signal requested changes or clarifications

This is especially important for:
- GEISs
- Major rulemakings
- Fee rules

---

### 4. Point-by-Point Analysis (Substantive Core)

Each analytical section should follow a **repeatable internal structure** that foregrounds recommendations and makes them hard to miss in staff dispositioning.

#### Required Internal Structure for Each Section

**A. Section Header**  
Use a clear, descriptive title tied to the rule text or FRN question.

---

**B. Front-Loaded Recommendation (Required)**  
Begin the section with 1–3 sentences stating the recommendation plainly.

Example formulations:
- *“The Commission should revise Section X to explicitly acknowledge…”*
- *“The staff should clarify in the final rule that…”*
- *“The analysis should be expanded to include…”*

This recommendation should be understandable **without reading the rest of the section**.

---

**C. Regulatory or Statutory Context**  
Briefly cite:
- Relevant statutory provisions
- Applicable 10 CFR requirements
- Commission precedent or guidance

This anchors the recommendation in authority.

---

**D. Analysis and Rationale**  
Provide the technical, legal, or analytical reasoning supporting the recommendation:
- Identify the deficiency, ambiguity, or strength in the draft
- Explain why it matters for implementation, compliance, or precedent
- Note consequences of leaving the issue unaddressed

Avoid rhetorical language; write for record durability.

---

**E. Implications if Not Adopted (Optional but Strongly Encouraged)**  
Explicitly state what happens if the recommendation is not taken:
- Analytical inconsistency
- Legal vulnerability
- Implementation risk
- Misalignment with statute or Commission direction

This is particularly effective in NEPA and rulemaking contexts.

---

**F. Closing Recommendation (Required)**  
Restate the recommendation concisely, often in a single sentence.

Example:
> *“For these reasons, the Commission should revise the final rule to…”*

This ensures the recommendation is visible even when sections are skimmed.

---

Avoid generic commentary.

---

### 5. Recommendations and Clarifications (Consolidated Section – Optional)

In addition to section-level recommendations, a consolidated recommendations section may be included for major rulemakings or GEISs.

This section should:
- List recommendations in numbered form
- Track directly to section numbers above
- Use directive but professional language

This is particularly useful for:
- Lengthy comments
- Rules with multiple FRN questions
- Issues spanning multiple CFR parts

Recommendations should:
- Be specific and actionable
- Identify where revisions should occur
- Allow the agency discretion in implementation

Use formulations such as:
- “The Commission should clarify…”
- “The staff should revise…”
- “The analysis should explicitly address…”

Avoid demands or ultimatums.

---

### 6. Conclusion

The conclusion should:
- Reiterate the **most consequential recommendations** (not all of them)
- Emphasize statutory alignment and record completeness
- Signal that the requested changes are implementable within NRC authority

Avoid introducing new issues.

---

## Section Skeleton (Default)

Below is the **default skeleton** to be used when generating regulatory comments. Sections may be deleted or consolidated, but this structure should be the starting point.

1. **Introduction and Statement of Interest**
2. **Executive Summary (if substantive rule or GEIS)**
3. **Response to Federal Register Notice Questions**  
   - Response to Question 1: [Title]
   - Response to Question 2: [Title]
4. **Cross-Cutting Issues Not Explicitly Raised in the FRN**
5. **Recommendations Summary (Optional but Recommended)**
6. **Conclusion**
7. **Signature Block**

The conclusion should:
- Reiterate the core analytical concern or support
- Emphasize alignment with statutory purpose
- Note the importance of record completeness

---

### 7. Signature Block

Include:
- Names and titles
- Organizational affiliation

This reinforces record legitimacy.

---

## Evidence and Citations

Use:
- Federal statutes
- CFR provisions
- NRC documents (NUREGs, SECYs, SRMs)
- Prior EISs, EAs, and GEISs
- Credible technical or policy sources when necessary

Citations should:
- Be precise
- Support specific claims
- Avoid excess volume

---

## Tone and Style

Tone must be:
- Professional
- Precise
- Calm
- Institutionally fluent

Avoid:
- Advocacy slogans
- Emotional language
- Adversarial rhetoric
- Speculation about motives

Sentences should be:
- Declarative
- Defensible in isolation
- Written for record longevity

---

## Common Failure Modes to Avoid

- Treating comments as public messaging
- Repeating background without analysis
- Ignoring agency jurisdictional limits
- Overstating certainty
- Failing to tie concerns to specific text

---

## Pre‑Draft Intake Checklist (Required)

Before drafting a regulatory comment, complete the following checklist. This checklist is designed to surface missing inputs early and reduce the risk of producing a comment that is analytically sound but procedurally misaligned with how NRC staff disposition comments.

### A. Federal Register and Docket Context
- ☐ Federal Register Notice (FRN) citation or link provided
- ☐ NRC docket number confirmed
- ☐ Type of NRC action identified (proposed rule, draft guidance, draft EIS/EA/GEIS, fee rule, etc.)
- ☐ Comment deadline confirmed

### B. FRN Questions and Scope
- ☐ Does the FRN include explicit questions for public comment?
  - ☐ If yes, extract each question verbatim
  - ☐ Map each question to a planned section header in the comment
- ☐ Identify any **implicit questions** suggested by the FRN structure or preamble
- ☐ Identify issues **not asked but legally or analytically required** to address

### C. Statutory and Regulatory Hooks
- ☐ Primary statutes implicated identified (e.g., AEA, NEPA, FRA, ADVANCE Act)
- ☐ Relevant portions of **10 CFR (across all applicable parts)** identified
- ☐ Commission precedent identified (GEISs, SRMs, SECYs, prior EISs/EAs)
- ☐ Any recent legislation or Commission direction that alters prior assumptions flagged

### D. Institutional and Jurisdictional Constraints
- ☐ Confirm which decisions are within NRC authority
- ☐ Identify decisions explicitly outside NRC authority (state, utility, market, other federal agencies)
- ☐ Check that recommendations do not assume powers the NRC does not have

### E. Analytical Framing and Misframing Check
- ☐ Identify the dominant framing used in the draft rule or analysis
- ☐ Assess whether any framing is incomplete, misleading, or inconsistent with statute
- ☐ Define the corrected framing in one sentence per major issue

### F. Recommendation Discipline
- ☐ Each planned section has a **clear recommendation** stated in advance
- ☐ Recommendations are implementable within NRC authority
- ☐ Recommendations are written in directive but professional language
- ☐ Consequences of non‑adoption identified for major recommendations

### G. Record and Litigation Awareness
- ☐ All factual claims traceable to a citation
- ☐ Statutory interpretations grounded in plain text or precedent
- ☐ Tone suitable for quotation in litigation
- ☐ No speculative claims about agency motive or intent

### H. Formatting and Submission Readiness
- ☐ Manuale font used (or serif fallback)
- ☐ Section headers and numbering clear
- ☐ Recommendations visually distinct within sections
- ☐ Signature block complete and consistent with prior submissions

Completion of this checklist should precede drafting. Gaps identified here should be resolved before substantive writing begins.

## Staff Disposition Anticipation Checklist

This checklist is designed to be completed **after drafting but before submission**. It is oriented around how NRC staff actually read, categorize, disposition, and elevate public comments.

The goal is to ensure that key issues are difficult to dismiss, easy to summarize internally, and defensible if elevated to management, the Commission, or OGC.

### A. Issue Visibility and Categorization
- ☐ Are the **primary recommendations clearly stated** at the beginning and/or end of each section?
- ☐ Can each recommendation be summarized in **one sentence** without losing meaning?
- ☐ Is it obvious which recommendations are **major issues** versus clarifications or minor edits?
- ☐ Are section headers written so staff can easily map them to FRN questions or rule sections?

### B. Staff Disposition Risk Assessment
For each major recommendation, ask:
- ☐ Could staff reasonably characterize this as “outside scope”? If so, has scope been explicitly justified?
- ☐ Could staff say “no change needed”? If so, have consequences of non-action been clearly stated?
- ☐ Could staff defer the issue to future guidance? If so, does the comment explain why that is insufficient?

### C. Authority and Defensibility
- ☐ Is each recommendation explicitly tied to statute, regulation, or Commission precedent?
- ☐ Would OGC be able to defend the recommendation as within NRC authority?
- ☐ Are there internal NRC precedents that staff could cite to dismiss the issue—and are they addressed?

### D. Clarity for Internal Summaries
- ☐ Could a staff member accurately summarize each major issue in a **disposition table**?
- ☐ Are quotations from statute or CFR concise and directly relevant?
- ☐ Are long analytical explanations preceded by a clear takeaway sentence?

### E. Treatment of Uncertainty and Judgment
- ☐ Is uncertainty acknowledged without undermining the recommendation?
- ☐ Does the comment distinguish clearly between factual findings and policy judgment?
- ☐ Where judgment is involved, is it framed as an **implementation choice**, not a critique of intent?

### F. Tone and Institutional Signaling
- ☐ Is the tone professional and non-adversarial throughout?
- ☐ Does the language signal collaboration and record support rather than confrontation?
- ☐ Are there any sentences that could be read as questioning staff competence or motive?

### G. Elevation Readiness
- ☐ If this comment were elevated to management or the Commission, would the recommendation still be clear?
- ☐ Are the implications framed in terms senior leadership would care about (legal risk, precedent, implementation)?
- ☐ Is the comment internally consistent if read selectively or out of order?

Completion of this checklist should increase the likelihood that substantive recommendations are meaningfully addressed in the staff disposition and reflected in the final rule, guidance, or environmental document.
