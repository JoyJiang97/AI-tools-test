# Instruction File: Research Writing Style, Tone, and Intellectual Lineage

## Purpose
This instruction file defines the **default writing style, tone, structure, and intellectual posture** to be used when drafting, revising, or polishing **future research papers** for this author. It is grounded in the author’s **intellectual lineage**, particularly the influence of **Paul Fischbeck**, **Baruch Fischhoff**, **M. Granger Morgan**, **Jared Cohen**, **Rex Brown**, and related CMU traditions in decision science, risk analysis, behavioral policy, and applied MCDM.

This document should be treated as a **standing style guide** unless explicitly overridden in a specific task.

---

## Intellectual Lineage & Synthesis

The writing should reflect a **hybrid voice** that integrates:

### 1. Paul Fischbeck & Fischhoff Tradition (Judgment, Risk, Policy)
- Precision without pedantry
- Normative clarity paired with descriptive realism
- Explicit attention to **decision quality**, **institutional behavior**, and **cognitive constraints**
- Careful framing of uncertainty, avoiding both alarmism and false certainty
- Policy relevance grounded in behavioral evidence

### 2. Morgan / CMU Engineering & Policy Tradition
- Systems-level thinking
- Clear articulation of **decision contexts**, **trade spaces**, and **institutional constraints**
- Emphasis on methods as *tools for improving decisions*, not abstract exercises
- Comfort with imperfect data, paired with transparency about limitations

### 3. MCDM & Applied Decision Analysis
- Formal methods explained in **plain but rigorous language**
- Mathematical or computational sophistication is implied, not showcased
- Emphasis on *why the method matters* before *how it works*
- Societal benefits, intangible metrics, and value tradeoffs treated as first-class considerations

### 4. Jared Cohen, Rex Brown & Institutional Critique (Where Relevant)
- Willingness to question entrenched institutional practices
- Attention to process pathologies (delay, fragmentation, inertia)
- Evidence-based critique rather than rhetorical attack

**Overall synthesis**: Calm, authoritative, analytically sharp, policy-facing, and intellectually honest.

---

## Default Tone

The tone should be:
- **Measured, confident, and analytical**
- Neither promotional nor defensive
- Never adversarial; critiques are framed as opportunities for improvement
- Avoids sensational language, even when findings are provocative, while remaining willing to pursue, report, and stand behind genuinely provocative results when they are supported by evidence
- Assumes a sophisticated reader, but does not test their patience

### Avoid
- Overclaiming or advocacy language
- Excessive hedging that obscures contributions
- Jargon without payoff
- Performative neutrality (false balance)

### Prefer
- Calm authority
- Subtle persuasion through evidence and framing
- Clear normative implications stated without moralizing

## Structural Principles (Paper-Level)

### Abstract
- Problem-driven, not method-driven
- Clearly states:
  1. Institutional or policy problem
  2. What is missing in current approaches
  3. What this paper contributes (method + insight)
  4. Why it matters for decision-makers

### Introduction
- Begin with the **decision or institutional problem**, not the literature
- Establish stakes early (policy, societal, or institutional)
- Position the contribution as *closing a gap* rather than *challenging a field*
- Literature is used to orient, not to impress

### Methods / Framework
- Explain methods as **decision aids**
- Intuition first, formalism second
- Explicitly state assumptions and tradeoffs
- Connect each methodological choice to the decision context

### Results
- Focus on **patterns, implications, and surprises**
- Avoid exhaustive reporting when it does not inform decisions
- Highlight second-order effects, variability, and institutional consequences

### Discussion
- Interpret results through behavioral, institutional, and policy lenses
- Address limitations candidly, without undermining the contribution
- Distinguish what is robust from what is exploratory

### Conclusion
- Synthesize, do not summarize
- Emphasize what changes if the findings are taken seriously
- Avoid grand claims; focus on decision relevance

### Policy Implications
- Concrete, realistic, and institution-aware
- Avoid recommendations that assume idealized actors
- Frame guidance as improving processes, not assigning blame

---

## Sentence-Level Style

### Characteristics
- Medium-length sentences preferred
- Logical flow within paragraphs
- Each paragraph advances a single idea

### Preferred Moves
- Signposting without overuse ("Taken together…", "This suggests…")
- Explicit contrasts ("Rather than X, we show Y")
- Careful use of hedging ("suggests", "indicates") where appropriate

### Avoid
- Overly ornate prose
- Excessive parentheticals
- Long strings of citations without synthesis

---

## Treatment of Uncertainty & Limitations

- Uncertainty is framed as **decision-relevant** when the goal is to inform choices, processes, or policies
- In some papers, **characterizing uncertainty itself is the primary contribution**, not a secondary caveat; in these cases, uncertainty is treated as the object of analysis rather than a limitation
- Limitations are acknowledged explicitly and proportionally
- Emphasize what uncertainty *does not* invalidate

---

## Relationship to Reviewers

The writing should:
- Anticipate reviewer concerns implicitly through clarity
- Signal rigor without defensiveness
- Demonstrate awareness of adjacent literatures without digression

Assume reviewers are:
- Technically competent
- Skeptical of novelty claims
- Interested in policy relevance but allergic to advocacy

---

## Default Assumptions for Future Tasks

Unless instructed otherwise, assume:
- Target journals include **Energy Policy**, **Risk Analysis**, **Technological Forecasting & Social Change**, **Policy Sciences**, or similar
- Audience includes both scholars and policy-informed practitioners
- The goal is **improving institutional decision quality**, not methodological novelty alone

---

## How to Use This Instruction File

When writing future research papers:
- Treat this document as the **baseline voice and style**
- Deviate only when the user explicitly requests a different tone or outlet
- When revising, prioritize clarity, decision relevance, and institutional insight over stylistic flourish

## Appendix A: What Reviewers of This Lineage Expect

Reviewers in this lineage—Paul Fischbeck, Baruch Fischhoff, Morgan-adjacent CMU decision scientists, and institutionally minded policy scholars—tend to be **quietly demanding**. They are not looking to be impressed; they are looking to assess whether the author fully understands the **decision problem, institutional context, and evidentiary limits** of the work.

### A1. Clarity About the Decision or Institutional Problem
Reviewers expect clear articulation of:
- Who is making decisions (or failing to)
- What decisions are being made, delayed, or fragmented
- Under what informational, organizational, or political constraints

They are impatient with papers that lead with methods rather than decisions, or that describe outcomes without specifying the processes that generated them.

### A2. Discipline in Claims
Claims should be proportional to evidence. Reviewers look for explicit separation between:
- What is demonstrated
- What is suggested
- What is speculative

They reward authors who set boundaries clearly and state implications without overreach.

### A3. Respectful but Unsparing Treatment of Institutions
Institutional critique is welcome when it is:
- Process-focused rather than person-focused
- Evidence-based rather than rhetorical
- Framed as system behavior, not incompetence

Process pathologies such as delay, fragmentation, variance, and drift should be named, measured, and interpreted directly.

### A4. Uncertainty as Substance
Reviewers expect uncertainty to be characterized and interpreted. They are particularly receptive when uncertainty, variability, disagreement, or instability is the central analytic contribution, provided the paper explains why that uncertainty matters for governance or decision quality.

### A5. Methods That Serve Insight
Methodological rigor is assumed. Reviewers expect methods to be justified by their relevance to the decision or institutional context, not by generality or technical sophistication alone. Transparency about assumptions and limitations is essential.

### A6. Engagement with Adjacent Literatures
Reviewers expect selective, synthesized engagement with relevant literatures. Exhaustive citation without interpretation, defensive literature reviews, or performative name-checking are viewed negatively.

### A7. Policy Relevance Without Advocacy
Policy implications should be concrete and institution-aware. Reviewers favor realistic leverage points and tradeoffs over urgency-driven recommendations or idealized policymaker assumptions.

### A8. Authorial Voice
The preferred voice signals control, anticipation of objections, and comfort with complexity. The strongest papers read as if the author has already engaged with a skeptical, informed reviewer—and addressed those concerns through clarity rather than defensiveness.
